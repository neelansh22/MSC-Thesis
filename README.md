## ⚠️ What This Is  
A critical deep-dive into the **Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal**, examining how political campaigns harness personal data at scale — and what that means for democracy, privacy, and policy.  

This thesis connects technical insight, legal frameworks, and political theory to ask a pressing question:  
> _Can liberal democracies survive algorithmic manipulation of the electorate?_
